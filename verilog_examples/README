There are two files: 
    -NB_DIGITAL_TOP.v
        Example top level verilog code that you want a testbench of.
    -NB_DIGITAL_TOP_tb.v
        Skeleton file of testbench we will use to autogenerate.

Run an example:
1. Open NB_DIGITAL_TOP_tb.v in vim or gvim
2. Outside of insert mode, type \a. This will run the emacs
commands to exapnd the autos in the background. Press enter until returned to vim.
3. File has been auto generated! Undo history is preserved.
4. To collapse autos, type \d.

See all the types of autos that can be expanded here:
